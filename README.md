# ObjectDetection
Short Abstract: 
I built an object detector based on gradient features and sliding window classification. I give my program a few bad images
good images so it knows what to look for in the image. The more examples you give it the better it gets at detecting the correct features. In the examples below, I only gave the program 5 good and bad images to detect faces. This program was done for a computer vision class.

Example Results:

Human Face:
